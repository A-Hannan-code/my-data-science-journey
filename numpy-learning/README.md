🧑‍💻 My Data Science Journey – NumPy Learning

This folder documents my hands-on learning journey with **NumPy**, the fundamental Python library for numerical computing.  
It contains examples, exercises, and mini-projects that help me understand core NumPy concepts.

🚀 Current Progress
✅ Python Refresher
✅ NumPy Basics
🔄 Practicing arrays, indexing, slicing, reshaping, broadcasting, and math/statistical functions
📂 Topics Covered
1. Array Creation (`np.array`, `np.zeros`, `np.ones`, `np.arange`, `np.linspace`, `np.full`, `np.eye`, random arrays)
2. Array Properties & Data Types (`shape`, `size`, `ndim`, `dtype`, `.astype()`)
3. Indexing & Slicing (1D, 2D, 3D, fancy indexing, boolean indexing)
4. Reshaping & Flattening (`reshape`, `ravel`, `flatten`)
5. Broadcasting (operations between arrays of different shapes)
6. Math & Stats Functions (`mean`, `std`, `var`, `prod`, `median`, `percentile`, `argmin`, `argmax`, `corrcoef`, `unique`, `cumsum`, `diff`, `log`, `exp`)
7. Mini-Projects (small exercises combining multiple concepts)

📌 Notes
- Each folder contains Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks for practice and mini-projects.
- This folder will continue to grow as I deepen my NumPy knowledge and apply it in real data projects.
