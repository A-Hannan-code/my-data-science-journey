# 🧑‍💻 My Data Science Journey

## 🚀 Current Progress
- ✅ Conda Environment Setup
- ✅ Python Refresher
- ✅ Coders of Delhi (mini-project in pure Python)
- ✅ NumPy Basics (arrays, indexing, slicing)
- ✅ Pandas (Data analysis)
- 👀 Eyes on Data Visualization (using Matplotlib & Seaborn)
## 📂 Projects

### 1. Coders of Delhi
A small social network dataset project built with pure Python.

**Features:**
- Finding People You May Know
- Finding Pages You Might Like

**Tools used:**
- Python (lists, dicts, sets)
- JupyterLab

## 📌 Notes
Each folder will contain Jupyter notebooks for projects, practice, and experiments.
This repo grows as I learn new concepts (Pandas → Visualization → ML).
