# 🧑‍💻 My Data Science Journey  

This repository documents my learning path as I progress through **Data Science**.  
It contains projects, practice notebooks, and experiments — starting from Python basics and moving towards real-world applications.  

---

## 🚀 Current Progress
- ✅ **Conda Environment Setup**  
- ✅ **Python Refresher**  
- ✅ **Coders of Delhi** (mini-project in pure Python)  
- 🔄 **Learning NumPy Basics** (arrays, indexing, slicing)

## 📂 Projects  

### 1. Coders of Delhi  
A small social network dataset project built with **pure Python** (no NumPy/Pandas yet).  

Features:  
- Finding *People You May Know*  
- Finding *Pages You Might Like*  

Tools used:  
- Python (lists, dicts, sets)  
- JupyterLab

## 📌 Notes  
- Each folder will contain Jupyter notebooks for projects, practice, and experiments.  
- This repo grows as I learn new concepts (NumPy → Pandas → Visualization → ML).
