## 🧑‍💻 My Data Science Journey
This repository documents my learning path as I progress through Data Science.
It contains projects, practice notebooks, and experiments — starting from Python basics and moving towards real-world applications.

🚀 Current Progress
✅ Conda Environment Setup
✅ Python Refresher
✅ Coders of Delhi (mini-project in pure Python)
✅ NumPy Basics (arrays, indexing, slicing)
👀 Eyes on Pandas (next step in data analysis)

📂 Projects
1. Coders of Delhi
A small social network dataset project built with pure Python.

Features:
- Finding People You May Know
- Finding Pages You Might Like

Tools used:
- Python (lists, dicts, sets)
- JupyterLab

## 📌 Notes
Each folder will contain Jupyter notebooks for projects, practice, and experiments.
This repo grows as I learn new concepts (NumPy → Pandas → Visualization → ML).
